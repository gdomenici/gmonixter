# Guido-Monixter Board Game

## Running & playing the game

- To start a dev server: `npm run dev` then navigate to http://localhost:5173/
- Input a YouTube playlist URL, such as `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99KH0TR-J4&list=PLcMK01bSTnE65yJUpsD4E3kAyy4kLBt7M`
- Play!

## Dev notes

- Had to downgrade `@types/react` to `18.2.19` (`npm install @types/react@18.2.19`) on account of [this bug](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-tailwind/issues/528#issuecomment-1856348865).
