# TODO

- MRU of recently used playlists
- Allow more than 100 songs
- Use customized audio player (see https://chatgpt.com/c/67336a30-b9e8-800b-bca0-28ee8dac587d)
- Style the "other releases" table
- Allow selecting part of the title for "previous releases" lookups
- Handle the case where the token has expired differently (use refresh tokens, i.e. no need to reauthenticate)
- Party mode üï∫üèª
- Possibility to alternate between player view and QR code view (see doc/README.md)
